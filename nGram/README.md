# N-Gram Models

This code trains an n-gram language model and evaluates its performance for a given n value ("largest_value" in the code as  a variable)

## How to run the codes for the project
- First of all, the programming language used in the code is Python and the version used is Python 3.7
- Moreover, the program uses nucleotide sequences of human genes datasets. Therefore, all of the datasets ought to be downloaded from [nucleotide sequences of human genes datasets](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bJHrZ0v36Om_bY3-nOkuHkKfT_dtJDuN?usp=sharing) and put into the folder called "src".  
- Furthermore, the program uses some external libraries which are listed in "requirements.txt" file inside "src" folder. They ought to be installed. Doing it is actually simple. Start a terminal from "src" folder. Then run "pip install -r requirements.txt" to install them.  
- Lastly, you can run the code by using "python main.py" command after setting the desired n value in the code by using "largest_value" variable and choosing if it will train from scratch by using "WILL_TRAIN_FROM_SCRATCH" variable.

**Note:** The execution time for the code is about an hour and it requires some amount of memory usage. In my case, however, 16GB of RAM was sufficient

Hyperparameter Experiment Results

The basic procedure followed is like the following. For any given fixed sequence length, we started with a hyperparameter configuration which looked reasonable. After that, if the model was underfitting, relevant hyperparameters are changed so that the model's capacity is increased. When overfitting was seen the opposite is done.

Initial Choice (Trial 1): 	val_perplexity: 3.4273
- EMBED_DIM = 256
- LSTM_DIM = 256
- NUM_LAYERS = 2  

Then 

Trial 2) NUM_LAYERS = 1		val_perplexity: 3.5816
Trial 3) NUM_LAYERS = 3		val_perplexity: 3.3880	(CHOSEN)
Trial 4) EMBED_DIM = 128	val_perplexity: 3.4449
Trial 5) LSTM_DIM = 128		val_perplexity: 3.4446
Trial 6) NUM_LAYERS = 4 	val_perplexity: 3.4131
Trial 7) EMBED_DIM = 512	val_perplexity: 3.4712
Trial 8) LSTM_DIM = 512		val_perplexity: 3.3934 (not stable)

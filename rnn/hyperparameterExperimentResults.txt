Hyperparameter Experiment Results

The basic procedure followed is like the following. For any given fixed sequence length, we started with a hyperparameter configuration which looked reasonable. After that, if the model was underfitting, relevant hyperparameters are changed so that the model's capacity is increased. When overfitting was seen the opposite is done.

Initial Choice (Trial 1): 	val_perplexity: 3.5257 
- EMBED_DIM = 256
- LSTM_DIM = 256
- NUM_LAYERS = 2  

Then 

Trial 2) NUM_LAYERS = 1						val_perplexity: 3.5951
Trial 3) NUM_LAYERS = 3						val_perplexity: 3.4770
Trial 4) EMBED_DIM = 128					val_perplexity: 3.4995
Trial 5) LSTM_DIM = 128						val_perplexity: 3.6067
Trial 6) EMBED_DIM = 512					val_perplexity: 3.5441
Trial 7) LSTM_DIM = 512						val_perplexity: 3.4399
Trial 8) NUM_LAYERS = 4 					val_perplexity: 3.4637 
Trial 9) NUM_LAYERS = 4 and EMBED_DIM = 128 and LSTM_DIM = 512	val_perplexity: 3.3305 
Trial 10) NUM_LAYERS = 4 and LSTM_DIM = 512			val_perplexity: 3.2726 (CHOSEN)
Trial 11) NUM_LAYERS = 5 and LSTM_DIM = 512			val_perplexity: 3.3610
Trial 12) NUM_LAYERS = 4 and LSTM_DIM = 1024			val_perplexity: 3.3656

Hyperparameter Experiment Results

The basic procedure followed is like the following. For any given fixed sequence length, we started with a hyperparameter configuration which looked reasonable. After that, if the model was underfitting, relevant hyperparameters are changed so that the model's capacity is increased. When overfitting was seen the opposite is done.
 
Initial Choice (Trial 1): 		val_perplexity: 3.7018 
- EMBED_DIM = 256
- FEED_FORWARD_DIM = 256
- NUM_LAYERS = 2  
- NUM_HEADS = 3

Then

Trial 2) NUM_LAYERS = 3							val_perplexity: 3.6932
Trial 3) NUM_HEADS = 4							val_perplexity: 3.7011 
Trial 4) EMBED_DIM = 512 						val_perplexity: 3.7189
Trial 5) FEED_FORWARD_DIM = 512						val_perplexity: 3.7064 
Trial 6) NUM_LAYERS = 4							val_perplexity: 3.6880 (CHOSEN)
Trial 7) NUM_LAYERS = 5							val_perplexity: 3.6903 
Trial 8) EMBED_DIM = 128						val_perplexity: 3.7022
Trial 9) FEED_FORWARD_DIM = 128						val_perplexity: 3.7095 
Trial 10) NUM_LAYERS = 4 and NUM_HEADS = 4				val_perplexity: 3.6959

Test Set Results For Trial 6)  	       test_perplexity: 3.6905

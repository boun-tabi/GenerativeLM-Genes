Hyperparameter Experiment Results

The basic procedure followed is like the following. For any given fixed sequence length, we started with a hyperparameter configuration which looked reasonable. After that, if the model was underfitting, relevant hyperparameters are changed so that the model's capacity is increased. When overfitting was seen the opposite is done.
 
Initial Choice (Trial 1): 		val_perplexity: 3.6601
- EMBED_DIM = 256
- FEED_FORWARD_DIM = 256
- NUM_LAYERS = 2  
- NUM_HEADS = 3

Then

Trial 2) NUM_LAYERS = 3			val_perplexity: 3.6472
Trial 3) NUM_HEADS = 4			val_perplexity: 3.6614
Trial 4) EMBED_DIM = 512 		val_perplexity: 3.6562
Trial 5) FEED_FORWARD_DIM = 512		val_perplexity: 3.6438
Trial 6) NUM_LAYERS = 4			val_perplexity: 3.6377
Trial 7) EMBED_DIM = 1024		val_perplexity: 3.6656
Trial 8) FEED_FORWARD_DIM = 1024	val_perplexity: 3.6454
Trial 9) NUM_LAYERS = 5			val_perplexity: 3.6331	(CHOSEN)
